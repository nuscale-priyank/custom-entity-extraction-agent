Entity Type: Account Identifier - account_number (Confidence: 1.0)\n   Source: BC3 Fields (Account Number)\n   Business Significance: Uniquely identifies each credit account, crucial for tracking and analysis of individual credit behavior.\n   Relationships: Links to specific credit limits and consumer credit data.\n\n2. Entity Type: Credit Limit - credit_limit (Confidence: 1.0)\n   Source: BC3 Fields (Credit Limit)\n   Business Significance: Represents the maximum borrowing capacity for an account, a key factor in assessing credit utilization and potential risk.\n   Relationships: Directly related to account number and influences credit utilization ratio calculations when combined with balance information.\n\n3. Entity Type: Credit Score - credit_score (Confidence: 0.9)\n   Source: Asset Columns (credit_score from Consumer Credit Database)\n   Business Significance: A primary indicator of an individual's creditworthiness and likelihood to repay debt, essential for risk assessment.\n   Relationships: Can be correlated with credit limits and account payment behavior to identify risk patterns.\n\n4. Entity Type: Potential Credit Utilization - Potential Credit Utilization (Confidence: 0.8)\n   Source: BC3 Fields (Credit Limit), Asset Columns (credit_score)\n   Business Significance: This derived metric represents the potential for an account to become over-utilized, a significant risk indicator. It's calculated by considering the credit limit in relation to typical spending patterns (which would require balance data). A high credit limit with a low credit score suggests a higher risk of over-utilization.\n   Relationships: Links credit limit and credit score to a forward-looking risk assessment.\n\nANALYSIS:\nThe extracted entities provide a foundational understanding of credit risk. The Account Number and Credit Limit are direct data points from the BC3 segment, essential for identifying and quantifying credit exposure. The Credit Score from the asset data is a critical external measure of creditworthiness.\n\nBy combining these, we can begin to infer potential risk patterns. For instance, a high credit limit coupled with a low credit score (as indicated by the derived \"Potential Credit Utilization\" entity) suggests a higher risk profile. To further enhance this analysis, information on current account balances and payment history would be highly valuable for calculating actual credit utilization and identifying delinquency patterns.\n\nSUGGESTIONS FOR ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:\n- BC3 Fields: Account Balance, Payment History, Loan Amount, Loan Term\n- Asset Columns: Debt-to-Income Ratio, Loan Default History, Employment Status","extracted_entities":[{"entity_type":"metadata","entity_name":"Account Identifier","entity_value":"account_number","confidence":1.0,"source_field":"BC3 Fields (Account Number)","description":"Uniquely identifies each credit account, crucial for tracking and analysis of individual credit behavior.","relationships":{},"context_provider":"credit_domain"},{"entity_type":"metadata","entity_name":"BC3 Fields (Account Number)\n   Business Significance: Uniquely identifies each credit account, crucial for tracking and analysis of individual credit behavior.\n   Relationships: Links to specific credit limits and consumer credit data.\n\n2.
